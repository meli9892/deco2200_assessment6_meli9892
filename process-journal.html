                <p>In design process, I did a lot of background research based on the information about the design process learned in the week 2 tutorial. According to relevant research data, the number of high-rise buildings in city is growing in past years, and the demand for high-rise maintenance workers is growing. According to the information on the recruitment website Seek, the number of recruitment information about high-rise rope workers has increased. Through background research, we can learn about the market demand for high-rise glass cleaning products. This helps us to determine the design direction. At the same time, I searched for existing technology for the related product. The technology of drones on the market is constantly being updated and upgraded.

This limits the scope of cleaning of the product. Through the investigation of the current technology, we have determined the feasibility of our products and understand the market demand for high-rise automatic glass cleaning machines. This helps us to design the product.</p>

                <p>For user research, I chose three ways to do it. They are questionnaires, interview and observations. Based on user research learned at week 3 tutorial, I established research goals and research questions firstly, and identified the main survey population. My main interviewees is building manager and window cleaner. I interviewed the building manager of our community and other building managers and the window cleaner that are working. The interview questions are mainly about the cost of cleaning, the time required for each cleaning, effecting of the cleaning, factors and preparations required for cleaning work. For the questionnaire, my main target is the residents of high-rise buildings and the residents of the town house. The problem is mainly about the cost, the way, the difficulty of cleaning, etc. of cleaning the glass. The main people of observation are window cleaner and the occupants who need to clean the windows themselves. I observed the working process of the window cleaner. I found that they needed to fix the rope on the roof and need to enter the balcony of the household during the cleaning process. This may affect the normal life of the household.

                <p>According to the information from research, we have created two concepts of the prototype. For the problems that the two concepts need to solve and the corresponding target audience, we have drawn 3 storyboards. This is the method mentioned by the tutor in week 5 tutorial. This can be shown it clearer that how different users are using our products. The target audience of the first concept is the town house householder. This concept focused on users to operate simply. In this concept, the product can clean spot through scan a window. Based on the results of previous surveys, I sketched the first version of the user interface. According to the user feedback form issued by the tutorial of week 9, I found some people to help me to test the user interface.

                <p> I improved my design according to their feedback. I added a completion reminder of the cleaning work, and changed some other pages. After that, I made Low-fidelity paper prototype in order to test this concept again. The main target audience of the second concept is the building manager. In this concept, the product can scan the structure of the cleaned building as a whole. In the user interface, the product does not display the camera content during the cleaning process. This can help to protect the privacy of the residents and reduces the impact of cleaning work on their lives. For this concept, we also got some feedback from users. Their feedback allowed us to discover some issues that were not noticed before, and is helpful for us to improve the interactive experience of the user interface. Based on feedback and group discussions, we decided to merge the two concepts. We have established two different modes in the interface. Users can choose to clean spot and overall cleaning when using the product. Partial cleaning is suitable for personal cleaning. The building mode applies to the building manager to clean up the entire building. After that, we made wireframe using the Sketch that we learned in the tutorial. At the same time, we made the interactive prototype through InVision. This will make that other to understand the operation of our app easily.
